<h1>Support the Author</h1>
If you enjoy something, it's always nice to be able to throw some money at the guy who made it, and as a plus, it makes it more likely that the manga will continue.
But how? No one's selling localizations of [insert manga here].<br>
Fear not, for we live in the era of information technology, and even Japan has started to notice that foreign credit cards don't bite.<br>
I will do my best to put links to all avenues of support I can find onto the manga pages here, but it can't hurt to do a little
digging on your own.


<h2>Manga</h2>
<h3>BookWalker</h3>
Assuming the author is selling something on there, <a href="https://global.bookwalker.jp">BookWalker</a> is the absolute simplest way to buy manga straight from the
source as a filthy gaijin. In fact, they're so eager for your money, they even made <a href="https://global.bookwalker.jp/info-purchase/">a guide</a> for us overseas
peasants. It comes with a YouTube video and everything! If you just want to support a manga a little, this is by far the easiest option.<br>
The only drawback with BookWalker is that their DRM is notoriously hard to crack. So if you're one of those weird people who actually like to own what they buy
<span class="spoiler">even though you can't read it, EOP</span>, or if their stuff isn't available there,
you'll have to make do with other services that are a bit harder to buy from.<br>

<h3>Kobo</h3>
One of those services worth mentioning is <a href="https://www.kobo.com/jp/en">Kobo</a>. Though remember how I said that they've started
to realize that foreign credit cards don't bite? Kobo is not quite there yet. But while they don't accept foreign <i>credit</i> cards,
they seem to have no problem with foreign <i>debit</i> cards. So if you have that, the only thing stopping you from buying their
manga is <s>a VPN with a Japan exit node (there are enough free options to choose from), and</s> a Japanese address, even though we're just
buying a digital product. And no receipts or anything will ever be sent to that address. And that address will never be checked by
anyone.<br>
What do we do about that? I certainly don't recommend you look up the address of a random fast food chain store and use that.<br>
And while the Japanese store is available in english (see link above), some parts of the checkout procedure may not be fully
translated. But it's nothing some common sense and google translate won't get you through.<br>
I believe in you.
<br>

<h2>Others</h2>
Apart from buying manga, you can also support the author through various other means. I will outline some of the most common
places where you can throw money at mangaka below.

<h3>booth.pm</h3>
<a href="https://booth.pm/en">booth.pm</a> is an indie storefront where creators can sell various goods, both physical and
digital, to an international audience. I have never bought anything physical, so I can't say anything about how that works,
but I've never had any issues purchasing digital stuff.<br>
What's on offer is basically completely up to the author. I've seen continuations of finished publications to 3d
models, and everything inbetween being sold on this site before.<br>
A great way to make sure the author gets a little more of your money than if you just bought a volume of manga.<br>
<a href="https://booth.pm/en">booth.pm</a> accepts PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard.

<h3>Fanbox</h3>
You can think of <a href="https://www.fanbox.cc/">fanbox</a> as a japanese alternative to patreon. You pay a monthly
subscription to access some exclusive stuff the author uploads there. I have personally never used it, but again, the site says
that they accept PayPal, VISA, and Mastercard, so you shouldn't face any issues if you decide to support an author through this
avenue.
