<h1>Suggestions</h1>



<p>
  <h2>neCo is currently accepting suggestions for a new scanlation project</h2>
  Below is a list of manga I know of that I could see myself working on.<br>
  Please feel free to <a target="_self" href="/contact">contact me</a> with your opinion on the below manga,
  <b>or with any other suggestions you might have</b>.<br>
  <br>
  Generally, I enjoy lolibaba romances, but anything with a cute enough loli will be taken into consideration.<br>
  Something between 15 and 20 pages per chapter would be ideal, but this is not a hard requirement.
</p>

<h2>Considering</h2>
Out of the manga I've been considering working on, the following three are the most interesting to me.<br><br>




<div class="dispTable">
    <a target="_self" href="/assets/suggestions/hakuchizu.jpg" class="dispTable_img plainLink"><img src="/assets/suggestions/hakuchizu.jpg" alt=""></a>
    <div class="dispTable_txt">
<h3>Hakuchizu no Reisende [Ongoing, 10 Chapters]</h3>
In the darkness, demons can possess living things and turn them into monsters. The darkness
thrives in the uncertain, so it can be driven back by clearly defining an area — by mapping it.
Rita is a moth loli who uses active sonar to map her surroundings at blinding speeds. Together
with a young Pioneer (and some extras), she sets out to discover the mysteries of the darkness.<br><br>
My personal favourite of the bunch, I think. But as it's a new series with a relatively broad appeal, there's always the chance
someone gets to it before I'm done with box goblin.<br>
Also, the more I think about it, the more I'm afraid of getting
stuck with a 100+ chapter unending epic that will haunt me till the end of my days. This madman is pumping out 20+
page chapters every week. And I mean, they're good so far, but I can't keep up with that.
</div>
</div>






<div class="dispTable">
    <a target="_self" href="/assets/suggestions/youjinbou.jpg" class="dispTable_img plainLink"><img src="/assets/suggestions/youjinbou.jpg" alt=""></a>
    <div class="dispTable_txt">
<h3>Kami-sama no Youjinbou [Ongoing, 4 Chapters]</h3>
Samurai is killed in battle. Years after the war, he is reincarnated as a servant
of the very fluffy loli kami of the night and moon, Tsukuyomi no Mikoto. He is
to exorzise "Kenomono", creatures that amplify people's negative emotions, to cleanse
his blood-stained soul before he can be reincarnated as... a rabbit?<br>
<br>
Problem with this one is, she's only a loli because she's been split from her main
shrine, so she might grow into a hag at some point. I'm scared of that possibility.<br>
Again, pretty new manga. And apparently it's a light novel adaptation.
</div>
</div>






<div class="dispTable">
    <a target="_self" href="/assets/suggestions/ningyou.jpg" class="dispTable_img plainLink"><img src="/assets/suggestions/ningyou.jpg" alt=""></a>
    <div class="dispTable_txt">
<h3>Ningyou no Asa [Hiatus, 10 Chapters]</h3>
A "love doll" escapes from a lab and decides to live
with the hikikomori wannabe light novel author who found her one night. <spoiler>Also, there's a talking
severed head.</spoiler><br><br>
It's weird, unsurprisingly a little lewd, and pretty cute at times. I'm tempted to do this one
just because it's only 10 chapters, and I doubt anyone else ever would.
</div>
</div>



<h2><i>Maybe?</i></h2>
Some more manga I've enjoyed quite a bit, but for whatever reason I feel
less motivated about working on them.<br><br>




<div class="dispTable">
    <a target="_self" href="/assets/suggestions/hebigami.jpg" class="dispTable_img plainLink"><img src="/assets/suggestions/hebigami.jpg" alt=""></a>
    <div class="dispTable_txt">
<h3>Hebigami Kagura! [Completed, 17 Chapters]</h3>
Snake kami gets fucked up bad and kidnapped, so the town she governs goes to shit. Her disciple,
a grown man who hasn't socially developed past the level of a grade schooler, saves
her. She gets a loli body, but has lost most of her power. They now aim to clean up
the town and make her a true kami again.<br><br>
It's very shounen-ish, but kind of in a self-aware way? Slightly? I think that's what it's going for? It doesn't quite hit home with me.
Also, the author doesn't draw loli nipples, but has no problem with hag tits, so I don't like
him. <code>And going by a cursatory glance at his twitter, he might be a furry too.</code>
</div>
</div>






<div class="dispTable">
    <a target="_self" href="/assets/suggestions/shinyuu.jpg" class="dispTable_img plainLink"><img src="/assets/suggestions/shinyuu.jpg" alt=""></a>
    <div class="dispTable_txt">
<h3>Shinyuu no Musume ni Semarare Komatteimasu [Ongoing, 31 Chapters]</h3>
Our average corporate slave protagonist suddenly has to look after his friend's
daughter, and she's hell-bent on becoming his wife. It doesn't go full drama and
EVERYTHING'S ON FIRE like most manga with similar premises I've read, which is nice.<br><br>

I like it so far. The loli's very territorial. Problem with manga like this is,
there's always a very real chance the author's just gonna pull out in the end, and
that shit's infuriating to me.
</div>
</div>






<div class="dispTable">
    <a target="_self" href="/assets/suggestions/cckk.jpg" class="dispTable_img plainLink"><img src="/assets/suggestions/cckk.jpg" alt=""></a>
    <div class="dispTable_txt">
<h3>Chinchin Kemokemo [Completed, 19 Chapters]</h3>
Miko loli gets easily possessed by animals<code>, usually ends up in some state of undress</code>,
 and her childhood friend™ then has to calm her down, usually by hugging her or something.<br><br>

It's cute and lewd. You can very clearly tell when it got axed though. This one
technically has a group working on it, but they release about once a year.<br>
Fun fact: The group that originally picked this up was so upset that people
kept tagging this romance manga as romance that they abandoned mangadex altogether.
</div>
</div>






<div class="dispTable">
    <a target="_self" href="/assets/suggestions/akuyome.jpg" class="dispTable_img plainLink"><img src="/assets/suggestions/akuyome.jpg" alt=""></a>
    <div class="dispTable_txt">
<h3>Akuyome [Completed, 40 Chapters]</h3>
Guy is lonely, so he does the only reasonable thing and summons a demon from hell to
be his wife. Without even looking up, he proposes to it the second the summoning
ritual is completed — but it's an absolute abomination.<br>
No worries though, it can turn into a cute loli. <br><br>
It's surprisingly interesting, and the humour's alright.
But while this is technically a lolibaba wife story, it's just not as nice and fluffy
as box goblin, aeka and co.
</div>
</div>



<br><br><br><br>
Chapter counts for ongoing manga as of 2023-02-02.<br>
Again, those are just some manga I know of. If you've got anything else you think fits the bill, please let me know.
