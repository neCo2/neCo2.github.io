    <title>Completed Mangaka-sensei to Zashiki Warashi</title>
    <pubDate>2023-04-02 06:48:10 +0000</pubDate>
    <link>https://neco2.github.io/blog/Completed-Mangaka-sensei-to-Zashiki-Warashi</link>
    <description>Chapter 29 marks the end of this manga. I hope you enjoyed, and please consider supporting Nukku. All relevant links can be found on the manga’s page.&lt;br&gt;
I will translate the extra chapters, but I will not stick to a schedule. They’ll be done when they’re done. Please consider purchasing the extra chapters on booth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Some fun stats about the scanlation:
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Including no-text pages (covers etc.), this manga was 624 pages long&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The project source files total to about 2.7GB of data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Around 3600 speech balloons were translated, for an average of ~124 balloons per chapter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <description>After anon in the scanlation thread
mentioned he was generating a static site from just one text file and 
hosting it &lt;a href=&quot;https://mycropen.github.io&quot;&gt;on github&lt;/a&gt;, I was intrigued
&lt;span class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;mostly because the wiki I set up as an archive on fandom
kicked me out for inactivity&lt;/span&gt; and tried to build something of my own.
He was generous enough to give me his code, which was a great help.&lt;br&gt;
This weird blog/wiki-ish hybrid thing was built using a combination of a lacking
understanding of html, python and &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;,
a static site generator. Similarly to what anon made, this site is generated
from one central YAML data file containing information about the entries
I want displayed on the page, and a couple Jekyll templates.&lt;br&gt;
This is also the first time I&apos;ve built a website, so if you want to keep your
sanity, I recommend you don&apos;t look at any of the html. It&apos;s an absolute mess.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In conclusion, I put way too much work into a website that at most 2 people will
use per year. But it&apos;s my website, damn it!&lt;br&gt;
If you want to have a look at the inner workings, I&apos;d be happy to share the source
with you. Just throw me a mail and I&apos;ll probably notice within a couple weeks.
